### Utility Steps Just for this assignment.

Then /^debug$/ do

end

Then /^debug javascript$/ do
  # Use this to write "Then debug" in your scenario to open a JS console
  page.driver.debugger

end


Then /complete the rest of of this scenario/ do
  # This shows you what a basic cucumber scenario looks like.
  # You should leave this block inside movie_steps, but replace
  # the line in your scenarios with the appropriate steps.
